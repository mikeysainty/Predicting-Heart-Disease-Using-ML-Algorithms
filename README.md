# Predicting_Heart_Disease_Using_ML_Algorithms

## Purpose
This project aims to harness the power of machine learning (ML) algorithms to predict heart disease using the 2015 heart disease data from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS), available on Kaggle. We conducted an in-depth analysis to understand the accuracy of different ML algorithms in predicting heart disease and to identify the most influential factors. The study addresses key research questions about population generalizations, statistically significant factors in determining heart disease, and the optimal minimal factors for accurate predictions.

## Methodology
We employed various machine learning algorithms, including Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and Naive Bayes, to analyze the dataset. These algorithms were chosen for their diverse approaches in handling classification problems and their ability to provide insights into feature importance.

## Dataset Features
The dataset features critical health indicators and demographics, such as high blood pressure, cholesterol levels, smoking status, diabetes, physical activity, dietary habits, alcohol consumption, healthcare access, mental and physical health, mobility difficulties, along with personal demographics like sex, age, education, and income.

## Key Research Questions
- What generalizations can we make about the surveyed population, and how do these influence the results?
- Which factors are statistically significant in determining heart disease?
- What are the non-significant factors?
- What is the minimal set of factors required for reasonable heart disease prediction?
- Which ML model performs best for this dataset, and what might be the reasons for its performance?

## Target Audience
Our research is particularly beneficial for healthcare facilities, medical professionals, researchers, public policy makers, and anyone involved in the healthcare field, providing them with insights into the predictive power of ML in diagnosing heart disease.
